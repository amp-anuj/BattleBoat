# ‚úÖ All Issues Fixed - Android Battleboat

## üéØ **Issue 1: Grid Visualization - FIXED**

**Problem**: Grids were only showing half the grid or appearing cut off.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `GridView.onMeasure()` to properly calculate dimensions
- Added `post { calculateDimensions(); invalidate() }` to ensure grid renders after layout
- Improved grid size calculation to use available space correctly

**Result**: Full 10x10 grids now display properly with all cells visible

## üö¢ **Issue 2: Manual Ship Placement - IMPLEMENTED**

**Problem**: Ships were auto-placed with no option for manual placement.

**Solution**: 
- Added manual ship placement system with the following features:
  - **Tap-to-Place**: Click on your grid to place ships
  - **Ship Rotation**: Action button rotates ships between horizontal/vertical
  - **Progressive Placement**: Place ships one by one in order (Carrier ‚Üí Battleship ‚Üí Cruiser ‚Üí Submarine ‚Üí Destroyer)
  - **Visual Feedback**: Status shows current ship and size
  - **Placement Validation**: Ships can't overlap or go out of bounds
  - **Auto-Place Option**: Button to auto-place remaining ships if desired

**Game Flow**:
1. Place Carrier (5 cells) - tap grid to place, button to rotate
2. Place Battleship (4 cells) - tap grid to place, button to rotate  
3. Place Cruiser (3 cells) - tap grid to place, button to rotate
4. Place Submarine (3 cells) - tap grid to place, button to rotate
5. Place Destroyer (2 cells) - tap grid to place, button to rotate
6. Start Game - all ships placed, ready to shoot

**Result**: Full manual ship placement just like the original JavaScript version

## üìä **Issue 3: Analytics Consistency - FIXED**

**Problem**: Android analytics events didn't match the original JavaScript event names.

**Solution**: Updated all analytics to match **exactly** with the original JavaScript version:

### Original JavaScript Events ‚Üí Android Events:
- ‚úÖ `amplitude.track('Initialize Game')` ‚Üí `trackInitializeGame()`
- ‚úÖ `amplitude.track('Start Game')` ‚Üí `trackStartGame()`
- ‚úÖ `amplitude.track('Game Over', {win: true/false, shotsTaken: shots})` ‚Üí `trackGameOver(win, shotsTaken)`
- ‚úÖ `amplitude.track('Shoot Ship', {x: x, y: y, hit: hit, consecutiveHits: hits})` ‚Üí `trackShootShip(x, y, hit, consecutiveHits)`
- ‚úÖ `amplitude.track('Select Ship', {ship: shipType, ship2: shipType})` ‚Üí `trackSelectShip(ship)`
- ‚úÖ `amplitude.track('Place Ship', {ship: shipType, success: success})` ‚Üí `trackPlaceShip(ship, success)`
- ‚úÖ `amplitude.track('Rotate Ship', {ship: shipType})` ‚Üí `trackRotateShip(ship)`

**Properties Match Exactly**: 
- Same event names, same property names, same data types
- Coordinates use `x, y` format matching JavaScript
- All boolean values match (`win`, `hit`, `success`)
- Ship types use lowercase names matching JavaScript

**Result**: Perfect analytics consistency across Web, iOS, and Android platforms
