## 🎯 Next Steps to Fix Analytics

### **Required: Configure Your API Key**

You need to get your Amplitude API key and configure it:

1. **Get API Key from Amplitude Dashboard:**
   - Go to [amplitude.com](https://amplitude.com)
   - Select your project → Settings → General
   - Copy your API Key

2. **Set API Key in Your App:**
   
   **Option A - Direct code update:**
   ```kotlin
   // In AnalyticsManager.kt, line 22:
   private const val API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"
   ```
   
   **Option B - Runtime configuration:**
   ```kotlin
   // In MainActivity.kt:
   analyticsManager.initialize("your_actual_api_key_here")
   ```

### **Test Your Setup**

1. **Build and run:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

2. **Check logs in Android Studio:**
   - Filter by tag: `AnalyticsManager`
   - Look for success messages
